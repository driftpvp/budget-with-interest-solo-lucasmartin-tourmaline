            Welcome to Budget with Interest. Budgeting isn't what most would consider
            fun. This application asks the questions: "Why are we budgeting?" and "How 
            can we keep motivated?" We believe the best answer is "Seeing our wealth grow"
            and this application has a unique tool to help you see that. It includes a 
            compound interest calculator so you can see how any spare cash at the end of the 
            month can grow!
